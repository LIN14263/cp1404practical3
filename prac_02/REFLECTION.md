## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been keeping up with the weekly lecture videos and finishing the practical exercises on time. This helps me understand the content better and stay prepared for assessments, so I will continue doing this.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I sometimes leave assignments until close to the deadline, which creates unnecessary stress. I need to stop procrastinating and start working on tasks earlier to have more time for review.
## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

For the practicals, I sometimes rush through the coding tasks without fully testing or reviewing my work. I will change this by taking more time to check my code carefully and practice writing cleaner solutions.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am completing the practical tasks each week and making sure I understand the examples. I also try to apply what I learn in the practicals to small tests in my own Sandbox project, which helps me reinforce the concepts.

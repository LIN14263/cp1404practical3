# Practical 06 Reflection
- What went well? Implemented data classes and encapsulation cleanly.
- I started to plan my work before coding instead of jumping straight into it. I now read the task carefully, write down what each function should do, and test my code step by step. This helps me understand the problem better and avoid simple mistakes.
- What was tricky? Remembering to avoid passing data the object already has (e.g., `is_dynamic()` should only take `self`).
- I still need to improve my time management. Sometimes I start the practical too late and rush to finish it. I want to begin earlier each week so I have more time to check my code and understand the logic behind it.
- What did I learn? How `__str__` improves debug/printing and how to design small, cohesive classes.
- Iâ€™m doing well in keeping my code clean and easy to read. I add comments, use good variable names, and test often. I also try to fix problems by understanding the cause instead of guessing, which helps me learn faster.
